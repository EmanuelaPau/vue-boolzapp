<h2><strong>HOW IT WORKS:</strong></h2>
This webapp it's a replica of a Whatsapp web page.
It contains different chats with different peoples. inside every chat there are the older conversations with also the contact and the messages informations.<br>
The user can send messages in the chat and he will recieve an Ok as a reply from the bot.<br>
The user can also search a chat writing the name of the chat user in the searchbar.<br> <br>

Pressing on the arrow in top-right message, there will be avaiable a new menu, in wich we could decide of deleting the message or to get some message infos (what time it was sent and if it was read).
